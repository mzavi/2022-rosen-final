# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Website to show info about a candidate for the election. Many gen z don't know what candidates stand for what, so creating a small website, marketed towards gen z that lets them choose a name and see what they stand for would be helpful
- Stock Market predictor
- something with data/dabases?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

- as of now, none

## Do you have any questions of your own?

- can you create an application with interface with python? Would that be out of reach for this class? Otherwise, i would keep it as a python file that you run in visual studio code.
