        <h1>Daily Habits</h1>
        <p>Starting small and keeping track of your consistency in all your habits is one of the most satisfying things you can imagine.
            With the first few days, do the bare minimum to tick off your habit for the day. For example, if your three habits are "Exercise, Read, and Meditate",
            you would do one pushup and tick off the exercise habit. You would read one page of a book and tick off the read habit. And you would focus on your breath for 
            5 whole breathes before you tick off your meditaiton habit. Obviously, you do more the subsequent days but this incompletedness is what's needed
            to start the snowball of you being consistent with your habits. The next day, do 5 pushups, read 2 pages, and meditate for 10 breaths. Next day do 10 pushups, 5 pages and 20 breathes,
            and so on and so forth. You could see how just in a matter of a week, you can go from not doing any good habits to being consistent in a few.
        </p>
        <h2>Important Tips</h2>
        <p>
            i) Start to see yourself as someone who does these good habits. Tell yourself throughout the day "Yea, I exercise. Yea, I read, I read 5 pages today, I'm a reader. I also meditate, I meditated for 
            5 minutes today. It's just who I am at this point." Once you truly see yourself as someone who does these things, it'll be kind of strange to see yourself playing video games and using pornography as well.
            You'll likely have some type of motivation to stack on more good habits and get rid of the bad ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            ii) If you start another habit, build consistency with it from bottom up, just like you did the other habits. For example, if you're consistently exercising, reading, and meditating and you'd like to start
            journaling, journal for 1 minute on the first day. 2 minutes on the next, 5 minutes on the next, all the way up until you've reached 30 minutes to an hour. Starting small is the main ingredient in implenting 
            the habit into your life efficiently and staying consistent with the habit.
        </p>
        <p>
            iii) Getting rid of the bad habits is as simple as not doing them. It's likely that you're addicted to instant gratifying activities (video games, pornography, social media, Netflix) without even knowing it.
            This is because of how <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103337?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed">dopamine works in relation to addiction.</a>
            Don't worry, you're not a full-fledged addict, but you're still quite drawn to these activities. The way to stop playing video games, stop watching porn, and to stop scrolling on social media is to realize its effects on your mental health
            and happiness levels and come to the conclusion that life will simply be better without them: you will simply be happier without these activites. Because that's all that we're doing all the time, right? We're chasing happiness, making the decisions
            that we think will make us most happy. You post on social media in hopes of getting lots of likes to make you feel better and, in your interpretation, happier. You play video games because it's fun and you're in a pursuit of happiness. 
            The same reason you play video games is the same reason Jeff Bezos started Amazon; he was pursuing happiness. He saw a life where business would make him happy and he pursued it. I'm writing this right now in hopes of helping at least one person, leading to happiness for me. 
            Now that you've realized this, look into the effects of instant gratification on your life and come to a personal conclusion (this can be done in a journal) that you'll simply be happier without them. A book I really recommend that talks about exactly what I'm talking about here is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+freedom+model&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsY_HZQgn9cAvOObpKoqqJG7MQe4ww%3A1670075323868&ei=u1OLY-bMNKKJytMP9qOGyAw&ved=2ahUKEwj2p56IzN37AhW9nHIEHdl7D_8QnZMFegQIOhAC&uact=5&oq=the+freedom+model&gs_lcp=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&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&si=AC1wQDAtx2BbmyBmykHcHVhKaK47kOmpLQo71wHmByllh5RL-6rtfqkytk3VtOGw92mWe4tET6Ii-2RQuGzCx71C11mxxHMNfMlaVyrSlBzfHnsa0CS0_PmTpeUbnFb1yzxOwppeVYv03bzy19WWMhZVrAoStOj-4BABZaiwZrAIDv4Nahc-CqXpJ2i5dmX-ppmPHyFymak1&ictx=1">The Freedom Model for Addictions: Escape the Treatment and Recovery Trap </a>

        <h2>Habit Tracker</h2>
        <p>
            Now it's time to create the habit tracker. You can simply avoid this and use a habit tracker app, but I prefer a real piece of paper. If it's out of sight, it's likely out of mind. You can put this piece of paper somewhere 
            you frequent so you don't forget to tick off the habits. Personally, I have my habit tracker on my nightstand and tick off the habits right before bed.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h4>Grab a piece of paper and a ruler</h4>
        <h4>Have at least 3 habits you want to keep track of</h4>
        <h4>Make one column for the day and add the number of columns that you need for your habits</h4>
        <h4>Make rows for each day. In the day column, put the month off to the side and the date of the day</h4>
        <h4>You're done bro, you should have a grid on your paper that easily allows you to track your habits</h4>
