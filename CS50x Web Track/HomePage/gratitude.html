        <h1>Gratitude</h1>
        <p>
            Practicing gratitude is simply reminding yourself to be grateful for the things around you. It can quite literally make you happier in a few seconds. For example, when I walk through my
            college's campus, sometimes I zone out and focus on where I'm headed to, completely forgetting my surroundings. Then I'll see a beautiful willow tree and quickly remember to appreciate its presence.
            Then I look around me, the bushes, squirrels, people, architecture, the library and school mascott statue. I'll basically force myself to feel grateful for all these things
            and it will literally make me happier. The practice of gratitude is powerful.

        <h2>How to Practice Gratitude</h2>
        <p>
            There's a few ways to practice gratitude. My personal favorite is gratitude journaling. This is where, every day, you open your journal and think of three things that you are grateful for. They don't
            have to be huge. It could literally be "I am grateful for this pen. It lets me get my thoughts down and store them on this book. I am grateful for this book, it's allowing me to dive deep into my thought and solve
            my problems." Now, there's some controversy about whether you should explain why you're grateful for x or not, but do whatever suits you in that moment. For instance, you might be feeling down and need an extra boost to feel
            grateful for something -- this could be accomplished with a short explanation. If you're low on time, you can skip the explanation. Do whatever you think is right.

            A letter of gratitude is another way to practice this. Simply write a letter to someone, explaining why you're so grateful for them. If you want to take it a step further, you can give them the letter. If you want to take it
            even further, you can read the letter to them in person. This is very powerful. It can bring tears to both of your guys' eyes and strengthens your bond with them.

            This could be considered "another way to practice gratitude" but it really just stems off gratitude journaling. The more consistent you are with gratitude journaling, the more you'll remember to do it in every day life.
            This is the practice of being grateful for things as you're walking around. You'll start to do it subconsciously and next thing you know, you're the person in your friend group smiling simply because you guys are all together and you're grateful for this moment.
            Essentially, gratitude journaling in your mind. Recall my example about the beautiful tree on my campus, I basically "gratitude journaled" in my head.
            The more often you do this, the happier you will be. Think about it, the more grateful you are for the things and people around you, the more things you have to draw happiness from. Instead of being focused on how many likes
            "he" got over yours, you're more likely to remember the time you spent with your family last night and realize that those moments are what truly matter. Here's an <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/benefits-gratitude-research-questions/">article referencing lots of research on the benefits of practicing gratitude.</a>

        <h2>Important Tips</h2>
        <p>
            i) Forcing yourself to feel grateful. This may sound like a weird concept but it needs to be addressed. When gratitude journaling, even if you're not super grateful for x,y, or z, you have to force yourself to feel that gratefulness.
            Think about it, if you're writing "I am grateful for my teacher" without actually making yourself feel grateful for your teacher, it won't make you happy and you won't remember the feeling needed to transfer into your daily life.
            If you write "I am grateful for this pen" and then take a minute to sit back and make yourself feel grateful for the pen, you'll be happier and you'll remember the feeling of gratitude to translate into your day. It's like forcing yourself to smile.
