        <h1>Mindfulness</h1>
        <p>
            This is one of the most important things to having good mental health. Mindfulness is the practice of living in the moment. When you're not mindfull, you're thinking about what happened yesterday or what could've happened today
            -- basically just daydreaming. When you're mindfull, you're completely in the moment with no outside thoughts. This translates well into gratitude, as you can appreciate the moment if you're not daydreaming about what could've happened at that Saturday night party.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Practice Mindfulness</h2>
        <p>
            Practicing mindfulness is very simple. What you're going to do (as a beginner) is close your eyes and simply focus on your breaths. If you notice yourself thinking, simply bring your focus back to your breath.
            This is the basis of meditation. You can use guided meditations as well, but get the hang of it with pure silence. If you feel yourself wanting to sleep, you haven't gotten enough sleep for the day.
        </p>
        <h2>Important Tips</h2>
        <p>
            i) You want to to have a "relaxed focus." What I mean by this is you're not using willpower to focus to the point of making your brain tired. You might experience this brain-fatigue. Simply remind yourself to have a relaxed focus
            on your breath and try to "relax your brain."
        </p>
        <p>
            ii) Once you completely relax into your breath, and you're completely and utterly mindful of your breath, you'll feel like you're in a different state of consciousness. In this state, nothing comes into your mind, time flies and you're at complete peace and tranquility. It's truly a wonderful state to be in.
            It's easier reached if you're listening to one of those "452hz Higher consciousness brain healing" sounds. This can be a goal you set for yourself. It usually takes 15+ minutes to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            iii) Once you get more advanced, you can start practicing sexual transmutation which also requires meditation.
