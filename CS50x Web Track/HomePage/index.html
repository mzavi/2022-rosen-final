        <h3 class="center">What is self improvement?</h3>
        <p class="center">Self improvement is the process of improving yourself. This comes down to your habits, your day-to-day life, mindset and fulfillment of life.
             You could think of it as "leveling up" all of your skills whether that be social skills, discipline, happiness,
             mindfulness, etc.. Self improvement is built on the foundation of mental health which is what this
             website will be focusing on.
        </p>
        <h3>Why specifically for young men?</h3>
        <p>More and more men are becoming weaker due to instant gratification activities such as: pornography & masturbation, 
            video games, fast food and social media. This makes us men less motivated to do hard work, less motivated to step
            out into the real world and grow some thick skin, leads to less confidence within ourselves, and therefore less friends,
            less romantic partners, and a less fulfilling life. This may sound like an extremist theory, but it is backed by science
            thanks to the in-depth research available on <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/dopamine-affects-how-brain-decides-whether-goal-worth-effort">dopamine.</a>
