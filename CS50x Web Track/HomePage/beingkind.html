        <h1>Being Kind</h1>
        <p>
            This is pretty simple. Give someone a compliment or perform an act of kindness. You've probably heard this a million times and are thinking "ohh perform an act of kindness, haven't heard that one before" but trust me, it
            is powerful. If you've ever given a stranger a compliment, which you probably have, you know the feeling you get walking away from it. You can't help but feel happy. Because you know damn well you remember every compliment
            you've ever gotten and how it made you feel in the moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Important Tips</h2>
        <p>i) If you can tell someone is wearing something nice to stand out, it's an easy compliment that they'll really appreciate. Think about how you feel walking around, wearing something extra nice that day. It would feel nice to be rewarded for your efforts, right?</p>
