# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Simple Data Organizer 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that organizes badly organized data

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will take a database of my choosing and organize it in a way that is comprehendable to the user. I may either do 1 database or a choice of 3 dealing with different subjects.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project will have 3 choices for the user to pick. He picks one source and it prints out all the data in a way that is easy to read and understand. Perhaps update the data in real time. Still looking for a data source.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Learn to incorporate SQL and SQLite

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Build a beautiful interface as well. Can I do that with python? Maybe with pyScript 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will learn to pull data from a website / create a dictionary with the data OR create a database. I will learn to organize data efficiently and diplaying it an an efficient manner for the user to read. Might learn SQL and/or SQLite.
